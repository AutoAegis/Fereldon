            <h1>The Birth of an Emperor</h1>
            <p>Varka Castiglione, the Conqueror of Ariselle, the Amethyst Emperor, is described as a figure of cunning prowess, exceptional intelligence, and burning ambition in the records of royal history. Born amidst the fractious courts of the Arisellian dark age, his family fought to survive through their unity with the other 13 prominent clans that would later form most of Great Ariselle. As a young man, Varka bore witness to his three elder sisters, above him in court, scheming for control through means of religious influence, sexual manipulation, political intrigue, and military prowess. This inspired him to follow his own ambition above all else.</p>

            <h2>The Founding of Fereldan</h2>
            <p>Following shortly after the end of the Arisellian dark age, the 13 prominent clans began to unify, looking to create a place for everyone to come together in times of great peril, ultimately founding the city of Fereldan, the now capital of Regalith and the Empire. With many of the original 13 clans present within the budding city and its court, the many differences in opinion and morals began to manifest themselves in both physical conflict and political intrigue. It was clear that there needed to be one voice, above all, to provide concise guidance and decisive clarity, to preserve the union that was the foundation of Fereldan.</p>

            <h2>The First Throne of Ariselle</h2>
            <p>After days of debate between the clans and religious leaders, it was decided that Castiglione, the 11th strongest clan of Fereldan, was to be the seat of power. Though not the most powerful or influential, Castiglione was widely respected throughout the 13, making the only male heir, Varka Castiglione, known to be both a firm leader and renowned warrior, Emperor of Great Ariselle. This appointment quelled much of the bickering and infighting for a time, but very few moons had passed under this newly reformed Empire before more of the same was to come. Imperial Princess Adwenna and High Princess Adeena, elder sisters to Varka, had both long desired to rule the Empire themselves. Before long, they raised their own banners in contention for the throne of their younger brother. This familial betrayal outraged Varka, and with his eldest sister Aenna’s blessing, he drew his sword and took to defending his rule, maintaining order, and stomping out the fire of rebellion.</p>

            <h2>The Parlay of Blood</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately for the newly formed Empire, Varka’s campaign against his sisters had not gone well. With both sisters having gathered allies from nearby rebels and those who supported female rule, much of Ariselle was ridden with both crime and constant conflict, weakening Varka’s grip and control across the Empire. Although Varka believed his sisters' own treasonous actions and betrayal would rally the people to his cause, it appeared to only embolden both their own, inspiring other separatist factions. The time for Varka to act was now, and with the signs written all over the wall, Varka hailed his sisters and demanded a private parlay, hoping to salvage peace out of the mess created from the once unified Empire. In an effort many didn’t see coming from the Emperor, he petitioned to his sisters, offering them both royal appointment and prestige, going as far as to assign them both places in his own court, using his familial ties to entice Adwenna and Adeena into ceasing their rebellions. This appeal was agreed upon by the three, and before long, the realms were at peace once more, with both sisters taking their respective positions and subsequent marriages to influential clans. This was less than ideal for Varka, but clearly the best choice in regard to having any hope of peace and prosperity. Varka knew to keep his friends close and his enemies closer, and with this time of peace, he took to plotting for full control of his Empire.</p>

            <h2>The Restoration of Order</h2>
            <p>What followed was a time of great uncertainty for the Empire. The forming of a well-established government had many hiccups, being described by history as a tumultuous and unstable period. With the wounds of civil war still fresh on everyone's mind, many were uncertain of the Empire's future. Varka’s reputation had taken a serious hit as a result, and many of his people and his courtiers still held sentiments for his rebellious sisters, believing Varka to be a cowardly, weak leader. Varka was not without his own supporters, however, and after some time, the Amethyst Emperor and his personal retinue of counselors hatched and executed a plan to dispose of his traitorous sisters, disregarding both his eldest sister and religious leader’s better judgments. The Emperor’s intentions for Adwenna and Adeena were well hidden, and over the years that followed, he slowly and carefully put into action his plan to remove them both, successfully poisoning Adwenna, and exiling Adeena, shortly before her subsequent “mysterious and unexplainable” death, burying any possibility of succession alongside them both. With both his sisters dead, the Amethyst Emperor released the slaves and governesses of their households, rewarded turncoats with handsome rewards and suitable spouses to settle with, and married off their children to governors of distant provinces. This forced the faithful of Adwenna and Adeena to settle remotely, away from the capital or nearby cities, in a play to dispel the ever-popular title that their people had bestowed upon him—“Kinslayer.” With this renewed sense of control, Varka began to focus his efforts on life outside of his courtly duties, marrying his eldest sister Aenna and starting a family of his own, siring 14 children in total, with 8 of them surviving to adulthood.</p>

		<section class="content">
            <p>Far from a perfect man, Varka would spend the next few decades repeating many of the same diplomatic injustices, quelling rebellion after rebellion, uprising after uprising, eventually forging a momentarily lasting peace as a result of alliances forged with the Dwarves and outlying Human clans, bringing the rest of Ariselle to a knee through intrigue and force. Emperor Varka would go on to serve as Emperor for another number of years, eventually being succeeded by his son, known to history as Tymond the Onyx Emperor, after his eventual passing at the age of 84.</p>
